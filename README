Assignment: MP 2 CSC 456 Fall 2015

We modified the following files in the kernel source code:
    arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
    include/linux/syscalls.h
    kernel/Makefile
We added the following files to the kernel source code:
    include/linux/prinfo.h
    kernel/prinfo/prinfo.c
    
We split the work up in the following way:
    Wolf figured out how to create a new system call (SYSCALL_DEFINE, modifiying
    header files, etc) and filled in the second half of the struct.
    Peter wrote most of the test functions and filled in the first half of the 
    struct.
    We both contributed to debugging and testing at various points.
    
Experiments:
